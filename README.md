## üì± Project Description

Q-TALK is a Quantum Secure Messaging App designed to provide a safe and private chatting experience by protecting users from unwanted or inappropriate messages. It leverages modern mobile technologies with Expo and React Native to deliver a seamless communication experience with a focus on user safety, privacy, and a friendly interface.

The app includes several key safety features:

- **Message Blocking**: Users can block senders who send offensive or inappropriate messages
- **Content Blurring**: Messages from unknown senders are automatically blurred until the user chooses to view them
- **Screenshot Prevention**: Prevents users from capturing sensitive conversations
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures that private messages remain confidential
